				    <h3>WHERE SHOULD I GO TO HAVE ONE?</h3>
				    <p>Ideally your nearest sexual health clinic. Your GP may be able to perform some of the tests, but you'll get more specialist advice and treatment at a sexual health clinic.</p>
				    <p>Some health clinics for young people may offer sexual health services and advice, as well.</p>
				    <p><a href="#clinics">Click here for your local clinics</a></p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>WILL IT BE CONFIDENTIAL?</h4>
				    <h3>WILL IT BE CONFIDENTIAL?</h3>
				    <p>Special laws exist to protect personal information at a sexual health clinic, so all information you provide stays confidential.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>CAN I GIVE A FALSE NAME AND DETAILS?</h4>
				    <h3>CAN I GIVE A FALSE NAME AND DETAILS?</h3>
				    <p>Most clinics prefer if you give your details or ask to be 'anonymous’ rather than give a false name. It is helpful if you remember these details however for when you need to return! </p>
					<p>It is always useful if the clinic has a means of contacting you if, for example, they need to let you know about an infection that needs treatment.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>WHAT IF I'M UNDER 16?</h4>
				    <h3>WHAT IF I'M UNDER 16?</h3>
				    <p>You can still be seen in complete confidence if you are under the age of 16. If you test positive for an infection, they would keep that information confidential. </p>
					<p>They will not inform your parents, school or doctor unless there is a serious Child Protection Issue.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>DO I HAVE TO STATE WHICH STI I WANT TO BE TESTED FOR?</h4>
				    <h3>DO I HAVE TO STATE WHICH STI I WANT TO BE TESTED FOR?</h3>
				    <p>The doctor, nurse or sexual health advisor will ask some questions to build up a picture of your sexual history and help decide what tests need to be done. </p>
					<p>Quite often young people will be seen by a sexual health adviser or nurse before seeing the doctor to discuss your concerns and answer any questions that you may have.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS WILL THEY ASK ME?</h4>
				    <h3>WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS WILL THEY ASK ME?</h3>
				    <ul>
				    	<li>What are you concerned about?</li>
				    	<li>Whether you are in a relationship or not.</li>
				    	<li>Who you’ve had sex with recently and whether they were male or female?</li>
				    	<li>What type of sex was it (e.g. vaginal/anal/oral etc)?</li>
				    	<li>Whether you used condoms?</li>
				    	<li>Have you ever had an STI before?</li>
				    	<li>Are you on any medication?</li>
				    </ul>
				    <p>It is important to answer truthfully, as the tests you have will be based on your answers.</p>
				    <p>If you are unsure why some of the questions are asked, explain that you want a clearer explanation.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>WHAT DO THE TESTS INVOLVE?</h4>
				    <h3>WHAT DO THE TESTS INVOLVE?</h3>
				    <p>What tests you have depends on the sexual history that you will have discussed with the doctor. You may have one or more of the following tests, depending on what infections you are being tested for:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Urine test (try not to go to the toilet for two hours before the test).</li>
						<li>Samples for various infections from the urethra, vagina, cervix (neck of the womb), throat or rectum. These are sometimes called swabs.</li> 
						<li>For females with no symptoms you may be able to do your own ‘swab’.</li>
						<li>The doctor may use something called a speculum to examine female patients.</li>
						<li>HIV testing is routinely offered in all GUM clinics. Blood test and vaccination for Hepatitis B may be offered.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The swabs or tests aren't painful, but they can sometimes be a little uncomfortable. If you are worried about any of the tests, always speak to the doctor or nurse that is doing them beforehand.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS?</h4>
				    <h3>HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS?</h3>
				    <p>Some results can be given immediately if the presence of an infection shows up by direct observation, however most will have to be sent to a laboratory. </p>
				    <p>You may be asked to phone or return for another appointment in a week or so to discuss your results.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>DO I HAVE TO PAY?</h4>
				    <h3>DO I HAVE TO PAY?</h3>
				    <p>All tests and treatment are free, along with condoms and lubricants.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RESULTS ARE POSITIVE?</h4>
				    <h3>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RESULTS ARE POSITIVE?</h3>
				    <p>First the sexual health advisor would talk to you about the nature of the infection and what sort of treatment it will involve. They would also discuss the importance of contacting partners, which is essential in terms of stopping the spread of infections. You can do this on your own, or they can sometimes do that on your behalf.</p>
				    <p>You may need to see a sexual health adviser again, who will discuss these issues with you and give you further information and advice.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="e">
				    <h4>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I BE TESTED FROM NOW ON?</h4>
				    <h3>HOW OFTEN SHOULD I BE TESTED FROM NOW ON?</h3>
				    <p>It entirely depends on whether you are in a regular relationship and whether you think you may have been in contact with an STI. The main thing to remember is, if in doubt check it out.</p>
